# R-Ladies Organizer Guide

## Editors: Angela Li, Janani Ravi, Kim Fitter, Alice Walsh, Jen Richmond, Soumya Kalra, Yanina Bellini Saibene

The goal of this resource is to help you become a more effective R-Ladies Meetup organizer. Whether you've organized community groups before, or this is your first foray into community organizing, this guide aims to help you:

- Organize effective events
- Spread the word about your Meetup
- Get sponsors (and swag) for your Meetup
- Recruit and support co-organizers
- Deal with tricky issues: some perspectives on allowing men to come + teaching effective allyship
- Build a community that runs itself!

Learning how to effectively run and organize a chapter once you've started an R-Ladies group can be tricky, but I want to share what I've learned in the process of starting a Meetup to share with you and future organizers. Organizing is a skill, just like learning to program, and having a friendly guide can make all the difference.

(This will eventually take the format of a bookdown book, but the above is my vision for this resource.)
